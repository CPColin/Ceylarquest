# Ceylarquest

Ceylarquest is a port of the TropicHop Java code to Ceylon with the following soft goals:

* Practice using Ceylon.
* Rework the logic and structure of the Java code to use more modern idioms, including idempotence, immutability, and other functional programming techniques, as appropriate.
* Write unit tests as the logic is written.
* Attempt to rework the `ServerModel` Java class into a web application that clients can `GET` game state from and `POST` moves to.
* Attempt to create a platform-independent GUI.

The current work-in-progress is in a branch.
